        <h2>FUTURE</h2><h1>Design Matters x Digital Photography</h1>
        <h3>10.6.16</h3>
      </br>
        <p>What is the future of digital photography in design? Some predict that photography was
          just a stepping stone for what is next to come. Stephen Mayes from Time Magazine claims
          “It’s time to stop talking about photography. It’s not that photography is dead as many
          have claimed, but it’s gone.” But the question still remains. What is this next
          evolutionary step for photography? After a couple recent years of smartphones
          revolutionizing the way we take, consume and communicate with pictures, we’re only
          starting to grasp the consequences — and opportunities — that new technology brings to
          photography. Severin Matusek, VP Community at EyeEm claims that Virtual Reality and what
          VR can offer are set to enter the stage louder than ever and redefine what photography
          can do in 2016. Here is a example of Rick aka ruei_ke has created through a 360 degree camera.

        </br>
        <p>According to Severin, Paul Melcher claims that <i>“photography wants to break free of its constraints...
          “No longer satisfied with the flat, 2D, static nature of photography, users are looking to experiment
          and adopt new photo formats. The resurgence of animated GIF, now common everywhere, has signaled to
          camera manufacturers, social media platforms and cell phone companies that people want their images
          to be more. From filters to stickers, from motion, depth and sound and many more to come, 2016 will
          be the year when the traditional photo format will explode. Prepare to see your photos not only move,
          have sound, be entirely immersive, have depth mobility, stitch with others, but, as well, be interactive,
          provide feedback, classify themselves, and automatically link to others of the same type. Powered by
          manufacturers in search of the next photo thing and fueled by users’ insatiable thirst for photography
          ( 1.2 trillion photos captured in 2015), the new year will bring a flurry of new experiments, mostly
          on our mobiles.”</i></p>
        </br>
        <p>This year will bring us new visual trends beyond those we predicted in this article. What photography
          is, what it can do and what it may become continues to be one of the key questions today’s photographers,
          editors, technologists and storytellers will have to answer.</p>
