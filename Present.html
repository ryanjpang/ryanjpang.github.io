        <p>Design Matters x Digital Photography</p>
        </br>
        <p>Photography and Web Design go hand-in-hand. With the high demand of photographers
          to take photos for their website, many web designers have decided to take on the art
          of photography themselves. Although it may be tough to learn, as long as the designer
          has the eye for photography, learning to utilize the camera can be done with a bit of
          practice. However having the eye for photography, lighting and composition may be more
          difficult to obtain.</p>

        <p>The famous cliché “A picture is worth a 1,000 words” translated in web design can mean
          the picture that ended you up with an additional 1,000 leads, 1,000 likes, 1,000 new
          subscribers, 1,000 sales or campaigns. According to Anne Pick, her words exactly,
          “Depending upon how well it’s done, 1,000 may or may not be an exaggeration”. Anne
          also believes the elements of your marketing and design combined tells your brand’s story.
          She and many other designers believe that the use of good photography on your website
          may be the tipping point of the success of your website.</p></p>
